# Data-Viz

This project practices object-oriented programming and basic data visualization using Python.  
We created custom `Book` and `Article` classes, added inventory methods, and used loops to display item summaries.

## Features
- `set_total_inventory()` and `get_total_inventory()` methods
- `title_year()` returns formatted book/article title with year
- `sold_one()` tracks inventory changes
- Final loop summarizes all objects in a store-like list

## Technologies
- Python 3.x

## Notes
Assignment instructions are saved in `instructions.txt`
